# polygon_task
the polygon task is meant to test the interns' understanding of core Java concepts like polymophism, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation

create a directory with your name where you will store all your files for the task.

# Task
Define a Polygon interface that has methods area( ) and perimeter( ). Then implement classes for Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon,
which implement this interface, with the obvious meanings for the area( ) and perimeter( ) methods. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, Equilateral Triangle, Rectangle, and Square, which have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple user interface, which allows users to create
polygons of the various types, input their geometric dimensions, and then output their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two such polygons are similar.
